# CODSOFT - Task 1  
## Python To-Do List Application  

This is a simple command-line *To-Do Manager* created as part of my *CodSoft Python Internship (Task 1)*.  
It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.  
All tasks are stored in a JSON file so that the data remains saved between program runs.

I also added some extra features to make the project more unique.

## 🔥 Features

- Add new tasks  
- View all tasks in a clean tabular format

- Task Priority (low / medium / high)  
- Status indicator ✔ / ✖
